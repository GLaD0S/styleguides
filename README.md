This [GitHub page](http://texastribune.github.io/styleguides/) hosts the
Texas Tribune style guides, living documents of its sites and platforms.

To add to the style guide, clone down the project repo. Install Jekyll by
running:

    gem install jekyll

To start the local jekyll build/serve/watch process, run:

    make serve
