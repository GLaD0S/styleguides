  <h1 id="main-page-header">Texas Tribune Style Guides</h1>
    <p>As living documents of Texas Tribune sites and platforms, style guides are built to visually match these projects. Each style guide uses the stylesheet from the project it records so that as a project's look evolves, the updated styles can be added in and the style guide will continue to match the project. </p>
    <p>The goal is that these style guides are used as a reference for grabbing code and consistently implementing styles, as well as being useful as a less technical and more visual guide. The style guides are meant to be welcoming and helpful to all who visit, and we strive to help each user get out of the style guide what she particularly needs.</p>
