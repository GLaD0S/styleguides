Typography
----------

### Typekit

The Texas Tribune has its own font kit through Typekit that supplies the fonts for the site. Typekit is loaded at the top of base.html to avoid a flash of unstyled content (FOUC) when it comes to fonts.

### Stories

Stories use Georgia, Times and serif. These fonts can be added with the `serif`
mixin.

```sass
.example-class
  +serif
```

### Headers

H1 Headers use Knockout 49 A, with fallbacks of Knockout 49 B, LeagueGothicRegular, Helvetica Neue, and sans-serif.


Color
-----

<div class="swatch three columns column">
  <div class="colorfield" style="background: #ffcc20;"></div>
  <span class="label">Tribune yellow<br/>$trib_yellow<br/>#ffcc20</span>
</div>
<div class="swatch three columns column">
  <div class="colorfield" style="background: #008990;"></div>
  <span class="label">Tribune teal<br/>$trib_teal<br/>#008990</span>
</div>
<!-- DELETEME shouldn't need a clear here -->
<div style="clear: both;"></div>


Layout
----

### Header/Roofline

The header is enclosed in the `.wrapper-r` class. Header ads are contained within a div with a `#site_roofline` id. User account welcomes are contained within a div with a `#greeting` id. The navbar, membership ad, logo, and time are contained within a header tag with an id of `#site_header`.

### Main Content

The main site content is contained within a div with an id of `#site_content`. Within that div, main content is contained in a div with a `.main_column` class.

### Footer

The footer, like the header, is enclosed in a div with the `.wrapper-r` class. Inside of this div is a `footer` tag with an id of `#footer`. The footer element contains a dl with an id of #staff_writers that lists staff writers.


Grid
----

The site uses its own twelve-column grid system. Below is an example of the
code used to create a twelve-column row.

```html
<div class="grid">
  <div class="cell w-12">
    insert elements here
  </div>
</div>
```
Below is an example of the code used to create a row composed of two six-column
halves.

```html
<div class="grid">
  <div class="cell w-6">
    insert left elements
  </div>
  <div class="cell w-6">
    insert right elements
  </div>
</div>
```

This grid can be divided up into any number of columns as long as they add up
to twelve. On mobile devices, each div with the class of `cell` becomes its own
row.


Responsiveness
----

The Texas Tribune uses two defined breakpoints, a max-width of 799px (medium) and a max-width of 520px (mobile). These are set up in the breakpoint mixin.

Sass for mobile and medium breakpoints:

```sass
.foo
  +breakpoint(mobile)

.bar
  +breakpoint(medium)
```

In addition, styles based on custom points are used throughout where needed for a design to look best at all sizes. A body class of `.responsive` should be added for responsiveness. This gives elements with the `.content-wrapper` class a width of 100% and max-width of the page width.


Navigation
----------

There are separate navbars for desktop and mobile. Updates to the desktop nav should also be reflected in the mobile menu. Both the desktop nav and mobile menu use the `.dropdown-toggle` class. Some JavaScript powers the dropdown nav, as well, and this can be found in megamini.js.


Images
------

### Image Sizes

There are nine non-cropped image sizes, and there are nine cropped sizes. Image sizes are indicated using media_size in html templates.

### Image Hosting

Images are hosted on Amazon Web Services.


Articles
----

There are several ways to indicate that an element is part of an article. It can be placed inside the article tag, given the `.article` class, given the `.prose` class, or given the `.mceContentBody` class. Scoping an article within `#site_content` can also help avoid selecting any additional page elements.


Bylines & Credits
-----------------

### Bylines for Stories

Bylines are styled with an unordered list with the classes `.meta` and `.separator`. The byline is inside of an li with the class `byline`. If available, the author's name should link to her or his staff page.

```html
<ul class="meta separator">
  <li class="byline">
    by <a href="/about/staff/first-last/">First Last</a>
  </li>
</ul>
```

### Credits for Images

Image credits are styled with a `cite` inside of a div with the class `.photo_links`. Wording is: photo by: First Last.

```html
<div class="photo_links">
  <cite>photo by First Last</cite>
</div>
```


Forms
-----

### Pretty Forms

Many forms throughout the site are styled with the `.pretty` class. Within these pretty forms, there are further subclasses of form, including `.errorlist`, `.required_field`, `.alert`, and `.help_text`.


Buttons
-------

These buttons are used throughout the site.

### Info Button

This button is used to link to more information throughout the site. By
default, this button is Tribune yellow. On hover, the button lightens by
10%.

<div>
  <a class="btn_info">Button</a>
</div>

```html
<div>
  <a class="btn_info">Button</a>
</div>
```

Widgets
----

Styles for widgets are included in the _widgets.sass partial.

### Featurebox

Featurebox is used for wire widgets around the site, including TribWire and TweetWire, and is often included in the right rail. For featurebox styles, use class `.featurebox`. Within the featurebox, there's a header with class `.featurebox-header`, main content with class `.featurebox-content`, and a footer with class `.featurebox-footer`. The footer often includes an adunit and a link to view more.

```html
<aside class="featurebox">
  <header class="featurebox-header">
    <h1>Header</h1>
  </header>
  <div class="featurebox-content">
  </div>
  <footer class="featurebox-footer">
    <div class="ad adunit"></div>
    <a href="#">View All</a>
  </footer>
</aside>
```


### The Most

The Most also uses featurebox styles, with the addition of tabs. The Most has three tabs: Shared, Viewed, and Commented. It's included on the homepage and in the right rail around the site. Add the id `#the_most` and tabs classes to a featurebox for The Most.

```html
<aside id="the_most" class="featurebox">
  <header class="featurebox-header">
    <h1>Header</h1>
  </header>
  <div class="featurebox-content tabs ui-tabs ui-widget ui-widget-content ui-corner-all">
    <div id="most_shared" class="ui-tabs-panel ui-widget-content ui-corner-bottom"></div>
    <div id="most_viewed" class="ui-tabs-panel ui-widget-content ui-corner-bottom"></div>
    <div id="most_commented" class="ui-tabs-panel ui-widget-content ui-corner-bottom"></div>
  </div>
  <footer class="featurebox-footer">
    <div class="ad adunit"></div>
    <a href="#">View All</a>
  </footer>
</aside>
```


### Trib newsletter signup

The Trib newsletter signup widget is included at the top of the right rail around the site on pages that inherit from the two-column layout. The widget includes a CTA for people to sign up for The Brief. The class `.trib_newsletter` gives the signup its styles.

```html
<section class="trib_newsletter">
  <form>
    <header><h2>Sign Up for The Brief</h2></header>
    <p>Our daily news summary</p>
  </form>
</section>
```


Icons
-----

### Social Media

Font Awesome is used for icons throughout the site. Generally, social media links should include "target=_blank" so that they open in a new tab.

```html
<a class="social" href="#" target="_blank">
  <i class="icon-[whatever]"></i>
</a>
```

Social Media Integration
----

### Facebook

Facebook comments are pulled in and included in articles' comments sections.

### Twitter

Widgets displaying tweets on the site should all use the widget from Twitter. There are a number of customization options that can be made to the widget to fit The Texas Tribune brand and a particular page's needs, including link colors, tweet limits, and more.

Html setup:

```html
<a class="twitter-timeline" href="https://twitter.com/[profile]" data-widget-id="[provided by Twitter]" data-screen-name="[profile]">Tweets</a>
```

Javascript snippet:

```javascript
<script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+"://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,"script","twitter-wjs");</script>
```
<!-- DELETEME add this space another way -->
<div style="height: 100px;"></div>
