Sass/CSS
--------

The Texas Tribune writes its CSS in Sass, both in .sass and in .scss. [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) is used to compile and minify the Sass.


JavaScript
----------

#### Loading

The Texas Tribune loads only essential JavaScript in the head. This includes [Typekit](https://typekit.com/) to avoid a flash of unstyled content (FOUC) before fonts load. Also included in the head is Google Analytics setup, ad setup, [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/), and [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/).

#### Compression

[Django Compressor](http://django-compressor.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is used to compress JavaScript. 

#### Organization

This JavaScript is grouped by core JS, plugins, project JS, JS for ads, and JS snippets for third-party social services.

#### Guidelines for Writing

JavaScript for The Texas Tribune should be written in a modular pattern. Immediately invoked function expressions (IIFE) should be used so that variables are locally scoped, and $document.ready should not be used.


Branding
--------

#### Logos

Typography
----------

#### Typekit

The Texas Tribune has its own font kit through Typekit that supplies the fonts for the site. Typekit is loaded in the head to avoid a flash of unstyled content (FOUC) when it comes to fonts.

#### Stories

Stories use Georgia, Times and serif. These fonts can be added with the `serif`
mixin.

```sass
.foo
  +serif
```

#### Headers

H1 Headers use Knockout 49 A, with fallbacks of Knockout 49 B, LeagueGothicRegular, Helvetica Neue, and sans-serif.


Color
-----

<div class="swatch three columns column">
  <div class="colorfield" style="background: #ffc200;"></div>
  <span class="label">Tribune yellow<br/>$trib_yellow<br/>#ffc200</span>
</div>
<div class="swatch three columns column">
  <div class="colorfield" style="background: #008990;"></div>
  <span class="label">Tribune teal<br/>$trib_teal<br/>#008990</span>
</div>
<!-- DELETEME shouldn't need a clear here -->
<div style="clear: both;"></div>


Layout
----

#### Header/Roofline

The header is enclosed in the `.wrapper-r` class. Header ads are contained within a div with a `#site_roofline` id. User account welcomes are contained within a div with a `#greeting` id. The navbar, membership ad, logo, and time are contained within a header tag with an id of `#site_header`.

```html
<div class="wrapper-r">
  <div id="site_roofline">
    Header ads
  </div>
  <div id="greeting">
    User account welcome
  </div>
  <header id="site_header">
    <nav class="navbar primary"></nav>
    <div class="ad last"></div>
    <div class="below_nav"></div>
  </header>
</div>
```

#### Main Content

The main site content is contained within a div with an id of `#site_content`. Within that div, main content is contained in a div with a `.main_column` class.

```html
<div id="site_content" class="content bare">
  <div class="grid">
    <div class="cell w-8 main_column"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```


#### Right Rail

The right rail is included on all pages that inherit from the two-column layout. Elements included in the right rail are the newsletter subscription widget, 300 x 250 ads, 'New on the Trib' featuring latest articles, and the Most.


#### Footer

The footer, like the header, is enclosed in a div with the `.wrapper-r` class. Inside of this div is a `footer` tag with an id of `#site_footer`. Inside of this `footer` element, there's a div with the id `footer`, and this contains a dl with an id of #staff_writers that lists staff writers, a div with an id of `footer_topics` that lists sections, a dl with id `offsite_outlets` with social media, and a ul with id `footer_nav` linking to pages like About Us and Donate.

```html
<div class="wrapper-r">
  <footer id="site_footer">
    <div id="footer">
      <dl id="staff_writers"></dl>
      <div id="footer_topics"></div>
      <dl id="offsite_outlets"></dl>
      <ul id="footer_nav"></ul>
    </div>
  </footer>
</div>
```


Grid
----

The site uses its own twelve-column grid system. Below is an example of the
code used to create a twelve-column row.

```html
<div class="grid">
  <div class="cell w-12">
    insert elements here
  </div>
</div>
```
Below is an example of the code used to create a row composed of two six-column
halves.

```html
<div class="grid">
  <div class="cell w-6">
    insert left elements
  </div>
  <div class="cell w-6">
    insert right elements
  </div>
</div>
```

This grid can be divided up into any number of columns as long as they add up
to twelve. On mobile devices, each div with the class of `.cell` becomes its own
row.


Responsiveness
----

#### Breakpoints

The Texas Tribune uses two defined breakpoints, a max-width of 799px (medium) and a max-width of 520px (mobile). These are set up in the breakpoint mixin.

Sass for mobile and medium breakpoints:

```sass
.foo
  +breakpoint(mobile)

.bar
  +breakpoint(medium)
```

In addition, styles based on custom points are used throughout where needed for a design to look best at all sizes. A body class of `.responsive` should be added for responsiveness. This gives elements with the `.content-wrapper` class a width of 100% and max-width of the page width.

#### Helper Classes

##### Hide on mobile

```sass
.hide-for-mobile
  +breakpoint(mobile)
    display: none
```

##### Show on mobile

```sass
.mobile-only
  @media screen and (min-width: 520px)
    display: none
```

##### Hide for medium down

```sass
.hide-for-medium-down
  @media screen and (max-width: 799px)
    display: none
```

##### Show for medium down

```sass
.show-for-medium-down
  display: none
  @media screen and (max-width: 799px)
    display: block
```


Navigation
----------

There are separate navbars for desktop and mobile. Updates to the desktop nav should also be reflected in the mobile menu. Both the desktop nav and mobile menu use the `.dropdown-toggle` class. Some JavaScript powers the dropdown nav, as well, and this can be found in megamini.js.


Multimedia
------

Multimedia elements are designated with the class `.media`, which is the container for images, audio, and video.

#### Images

##### Image Sizes

There are nine non-cropped image sizes, and there are nine cropped sizes. Image sizes are indicated using media_size in html templates.

##### Image Hosting

Images are hosted on Amazon Web Services.

#### Videos

Videos can be included from Youtube, Vimeo, and Livestream. [FitVids.js](http://fitvidsjs.com/), a jQuery plugin for fluid width video embeds, is used to ensure that videos maintain their aspect ratio at all screen sizes. To trigger fitvids, the video must be set up with a div with a class of `.video` that contains a div with a class of `.youtube`, `.vimeo`, or `.livestream` to signal that the element is indeed a video.

```html
<div class="media">
  <div id="video_container">
    <div class="video">
      <div class="youtube/vimeo/livestream">
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

##### Livestream

For livestreams, [Livestream](http://new.livestream.com/) is used.

#### Audio

TribCast and other audio files are Amazon-hosted Shockwave Flash files.


Articles
----

There are several ways to indicate that an element is part of an article. It can be placed inside the `article` tag, given the `.article` class, given the `.prose` class, or given the `.mceContentBody` class. Scoping an article within `#site_content` can also help avoid selecting any additional page elements.


Bylines & Credits
-----------------

#### Bylines for Stories

Bylines are styled with an unordered list with the classes `.meta` and `.separator`. The byline is inside of an `li` with the class `byline`. If available, the author's name should link to her or his staff page.

```html
<ul class="meta separator">
  <li class="byline">
    by <a href="/about/staff/first-last/">First Last</a>
  </li>
</ul>
```

#### Credits for Images

Image credits are styled with a `cite` inside of a div with the class `.photo_links`. Wording is: photo by: First Last. Images are credited beneath the image, and they float to the right, lining up with the right edge of the image.

<div class="photo_links">
  <cite>photo by: First Last</cite>
</div>

```html
<div class="photo_links">
  <cite>photo by: First Last</cite>
</div>
```


Forms
-----

#### Pretty Forms

Many forms throughout the site are styled with the `.pretty` class. Within these pretty forms, there are further subclasses of form, including `.errorlist`, `.required_field`, `.alert`, and `.help_text`.


Buttons
-------

These buttons are used throughout the site.

#### Button Neue

Button neue is used in newsletter signup widgets; account login, register, and signup forms; newsletter archive pages; district brackets; and the event RSVP form.

Button neue can be a few different colors. There's the default with $trib_yellow_bg.

<input class="btn_neue" type="submit" value="Submit">

A class of `.teal` makes it $trib_teal with #fff font color. 

<input class="btn_neue teal" type="submit" value="Submit">

A class of `.gray` makes it #d7d7d7 with #aeaeae font color. 

<input class="btn_neue gray" type="submit" value="Submit">

<input type="submit" value="Submit" class="btn_yellow">

```html
<input type="submit" value="Submit" class="btn_yellow">
```


#### Info Button

This button is used to link to more information throughout the site. By
default, this button is Tribune yellow. On hover, the button lightens by
10%.
