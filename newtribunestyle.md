Stylesheet
==========
{: .sg-header}

This is the new styleguide for [texastribune.org](http://www.texastribune.org), charting the direction our styles are heading in 2015. Some of its goals are to establish naming conventions and to create more modular, reusable styles for the Tribune. These modular styles will correspond with our content. They will also be designed mobile-first.

# Style goals, conventions, and budgets

Design Goals
----------------

There are design goals each entity should contribute to before being included in the new style guide. These should be referenced throughout the process to keep our focus on our design goals as we iterate.

* Increases enjoyment and engagement
* Creates a good experience for people using it
* Is part of a positive association with The Texas Tribune

Sass
----

CSS is written in Sass. It's preferred that the Sass be .sass files.


Naming Conventions
------------------

### Variable Names

Variables are used for colors and fonts. They're defined in settings.scss. If the color or font name is more than one word, start with the more general word first. For example, for Tribune brand colors, name them "$tribune-yellow" and "$tribune-teal" instead of "$yellow-tribune" or "$teal-tribune".

### Naming Conventions

Classes following the [BEM naming convention](https://en.bem.info/method/naming-convention/) should be used in most cases. Ids should only be used in HTML as Javascript hooks.

The naming of classes and ids should be done with the goal of creating modular entities to be reused and remixed throughout the site. There are no rules that always must be followed; however, this set of guidelines should be applicable to most situations. Things to keep in mind are also how easily searchable the classes and ids that you're using are, as well as if there are any potential clashes with current naming systems.

Naming will follow the BEM methodology. Modular entities can be blocks or elements. They can have modifiers that describe their appearance and behavior.

We will use the following words to refer to different entities within a page.

#### Base

Base styles are those applied generally with an element selector, a descendant selector, or a child selector.

#### Layout

Layout entities are the major elements included on a page, such as the header, main body area, and the footer.

#### Blocks

Blocks exist within the major layout sections.

#### Elements

Elements are entities that exist within a particular block, and not outside of that block. There should not be an element that exists within another element.

#### Modifiers

Modifiers are elements that indicate states or themes. These include such states as active, expanded, and collapsed.

Accessibility
-------------

#### Alt text

Use alt text to provide function, and not to provide content.

#### Navigation

It should be possible to tab through navigation.

Performance
-----------

# Layout, Base, Blocks, Elements, and Modifiers

Schema.org
----------

#### Articles
Articles should be tagged with Schema.org item properties. These properties should be included after an HTML element's classes. An article should have an itemprop of 'articleBody'. Headlines should be given an itemprop of 'headline'. Lead art should be given the itemprop of 'associatedMedia'. Bylines' authors should have the itemprops of 'author' and 'creator.'  

Color
-----

Color should not be relied on to indicate something. Color enhances our content.

Typography
----------

A root font size, defined in settings, sets the absolute font size. This base font size should be set in px on the root html element. Root font size differs based on the device width, and changes at tablet (799px) and mobile (520px). Root font size determines the absolute size of typography elements while keeping their relative sizing consistent.

```sass
$font-root: 18px
$font-root-tablet: 16px
$font-root-mobile: 14px
```

There will likely be a base serif and a base sans-serif font. These are yet to be determined.

We then have different sizes that are relative to this root font size. There are two smaller sizes and three larger sizes. These are sized in rems, to make their sizes relative to the root px size. If every font size should be larger, an update can be made to the $font-root settings. If only one font size should be larger, then an update can be made to that specific relative setting.

```sass
$xxl: 2.4rem
$xl: 2rem
$l: 1.8rem
$m: 1.5rem
$s: 1.2rem
$xs: 1rem
```

The classes for these sizes are ".font-xs", ".font-s", ".font-m", ".font-l", ".font-xl", and ".font-xxl".

This is meant to roughly begin establishing a system to follow; the system and these sizes may be adjusted as we decide on what fonts we are using moving forward. This system was inspired in part by [our news apps typography styles](http://apps.texastribune.org/styles/#typography) to keep cohesion where it makes sense between the two sets of styles.

#### Headers

Each header (h1-h6) is then given font sizes, weights, and any other styles. Header tags should be used on each page in the correct order to provide meaning and structure to the page with their use.

<h1 class="font-xxl">h1 header example</h1>
<h2 class="font-xl">h2 header example</h2>
<h3 class="font-l">h3 header example</h3>
<h4 class="font-m">h4 header example</h4>
<h5 class="font-s">h5 header example</h5>
<h6 class="font-xs">h6 header example</h6>

#### Headlines

Headlines are elements that exist inside story blocks. Article headlines will use an h1 header. They will have a class of .story_headline. 

#### Bylines

Bylines are elements that exist within story blocks. They should use the class .story_byline. The times in bylines should use the HTML time tag.

#### Paragraphs

Paragraph entities are given base font sizes and styles.

<p class="font-xs">This is an example paragraph.</p>

#### Icons

For icons, we'll likely use Font Awesome, which is what we currently use.

We'll follow the PRO method outlined on [this page](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/get-started/) in the Font Awesome documentation. We'll include the font-awesome directory inside the Sass for the Tribune project. Only icons currently used in the project will be precompiled; comment out any unused icons so they aren't included in the CSS, and then uncomment icons as they're included in the project.

Grid
----

How to approach using a responsive grid framework is still undecided.

Images
------

#### Lead art

Lead art is an element inside of a story block. It uses the figure html tag and has a class of .story_leadart. It should have a figcaption that contains a caption and credit. Alt should be set to "" to instruct a screen reader to skip, as its purpose is decorative.

Video
-----

Videos should have captions.

Links
-----

Links are a base style element. To be more accessible, links should not be signified only by the use of color. Links should not unexpectedly open a new window.

<a href="#">Click me, I go nowhere</a>

Inputs
------

#### Newsletter signups

Buttons
-------

Buttons are module elements. These updated button styles are inspired by styles 
originally used by news apps projects.

#### Yellow (default)

The default button uses the class .button_default.

<button class="button">.button_default</button>

#### Teal

The teal button uses the teal theme modifier and applies it to the default button.

<button class="button-teal">.button_default--teal</button>

#### Ghost

The ghost button can be applied to either the default yellow button or the teal button. The classes for these buttons are .button_default--ghost.

<button class="button-ghost">.button_default--ghost</button>

Ads
---

The goal for ads is to develop a system that seamlessly responds across desktop and mobile. One possibility is to standardize ad sizes as much as possible across desktop and mobile. For example, most ads might be 300X250 px.

Related Content
---------------

There will be a few related content blocks.

Experimental
------------

This includes classes and information on elements that represent what we're trying out and looking into next.

#### Read more
.story_readmore

#### Related Content
.story_related--story--inline

#### Related Media
.story_related--image--embed
.story_related--video--embed

#### Story Quotes
.story_blockquote

#### Story subheaders
