Stylesheet
==========
{: .sg-header}

This is the new styleguide for [texastribune.org](http://www.texastribune.org), charting the direction our styles are heading in 2015. Some of its goals are to establish naming conventions, to create more modular, reusable styles for the Tribune, and to increase cohesion between the Tribune's styles and our <a href="http://apps.texastribune.org/styles/">News Apps styles</a>.

CSS is written in Sass in .scss files.  

Naming Conventions
------------------

### Class Names

Class names should be used with the ultimate goal of creating modular elements
that can be reused in different ways throughout the site. There are no rules
that always must be followed; however, this set of guidelines should be applicable
to most situations.

Taking some inspiration from SMACSS and some inspiration from BEM, there are four 
categories into which class names might fall: base, layout, module, and state.

#### Base

#### Layout

#### Module

#### State

Buttons
-------

### Default Button

#### Yellow

#### Teal

#### Ghost
