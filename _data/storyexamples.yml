  headline: 'As Texas Universities Expand, Political Fights Grow Over Turf'

  body: "<p>For years, the geography of higher education in Texas has been clear-cut: Texas Longhorns studied in Austin, Texas AM Aggies went to school in College Station and Texas Tech Red Raiders were contained to Lubbock.</p>
<p>But lately, university leaders have begun working to bring Longhorns to Houston, Aggies to McAllen and Red Raiders to Costa Rica.</p>
<p>Those universities and others have sought to build or expand facilities far from their main locations. Their goal is to expand their reach and improve access for students. In the process, the universities have stirred up controversy &mdash; and complaints of wasteful spending and turf battles between institutions. Now, some state leaders have begun calling for more coordination and oversight of the universities' plans.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style='line-height: 1.35;'>&ldquo;What we don&rsquo;t want to have is this manifest destiny mentality, where you can just buy property and do what you want with it without consulting&rdquo; state leaders, said state Rep. <a href='http://www.texastribune.org/directory/armando-walle/'>Armando Walle</a>, D-Houston.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Branch campuses have been around for decades, but Texas universities&rsquo; interest in them has grown rapidly in recent years. And no college has been more active than A&amp;M.</p>
<p>For decades, the university has had a6 campus in Galveston where &ldquo;Sea Aggies&rdquo; can study marine biology and engineering while earning the same degree as those on the main campus in College Station. In 2003, Texas A&amp;M University opened a branch in Qatar, handing out hundreds of engineering degrees to students from the Middle East. And this year the university announced plans for a new satellite campus in McAllen, plus academies at four community colleges across the state where students can begin work toward engineering degrees.</p>
<p>A&amp;M was also planning to open a branch campus in Israel but announced this week that it is scaling back that initiative after concerns that local government wouldn&rsquo;t allow the campus complete academic freedom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are a land grant university, and our job is to serve the whole state of Texas,&rdquo; A&amp;M Chancellor John&nbsp;Sharp said of the expansion plans. Lately, he said, that means having the university go to the students, not just the other way around.</p>
<p>Other schools have done the same. Over the past decade, Texas State University, based in San Marcos, has expanded its campus 65 miles north in Round Rock, where it offers degrees in nursing, business management and mass communication. And Texas Tech, which already offers upper-level courses from two Hill Country campuses, has been working toward establishing an off-campus instructional site in San Jose, Costa Rica.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of those projects have been criticized as costly, especially at a time of frugality in the Legislature. But none has been as controversial as the University of Texas System&rsquo;s plans in Houston.</p>
<p>UT System Chancellor Bill McRaven announced in November plans to buy more than 300 acres in the southwestern part of the city. System officials haven&rsquo;t announced their full plans for the site, but McRaven said at the time that he expects students to do coursework there and professors to use the site for research.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The plan immediately set off alarms among University of Houston supporters, who said it would encroach on their hometown and harm efforts to build the stature of their university. At a UH System regents meeting, officials called the UT System effort a&nbsp; &ldquo;land grab and a &ldquo;Trojan horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The UH System Board of Regents approved a resolution expressing concern about the idea and argued that UT's unilateral approach was an affront to state leaders. Last week, 19 state representatives from the Houston area &mdash; 12 Republicans and 7 Democrats &mdash; wrote McRaven urging him to slow down and work with local leaders before purchasing the land.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appears many steps in planning have already been taken without consulting key leader and stakeholders,&rdquo; their letter said.</p>
<p>That kind of response shows a conflict underlying many universities&rsquo; expansion plans, said Raymund Paredes, commissioner of the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. The branch campuses are good for the schools&rsquo; notoriety and research but not necessarily good for the state overall, he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nature of universities, particularly universities that want to enhance their prestige, is to expand,&rdquo; Paredes said. &ldquo;You can never satisfy their appetites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regardless, there appears to be little that state leaders can do to stop the expansion. The UT System, for instance, has enough money to buy the land it&rsquo;s eying without any new appropriations from the Legislature. And unless it plans to open a brand new university or offer new degrees, it may not need approval from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.</p>
<p>Chancellor McRaven said he plans to convene a task force made up of local leaders to develop a plan for the site. Walle, one of the representatives to sign the letter of opposition, said he hopes the system will consider the feedback.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just because they can do it doesn&rsquo;t make it right,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Similar confrontations could be brewing around A&amp;M&rsquo;s plans. The university may soon begin offering degrees from its veterinary school at sites across the state. That could lead to competition with Texas Tech, which expressed a desire this month to open a veterinary school in Amarillo.</p>
<p>And A&amp;M&rsquo;s plans for its McAllen campus have caused rumbling from some state officials, who note that a new university, the University of Texas-Rio Grande Valley, just opened in the area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no strong evidence that the region needs more than one university,&rdquo; Paredes said.</p>
<p>Paredes said he&rsquo;d like to see the universities notify the Coordinating Board and Legislature of their plans further in advance. That would allow for more collaboration with state officials. He said he has invited McRaven to meet with the board in January and hopes other chancellors will brief the board at future meetings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to come up with policies and procedures that allow us to get an overall plan,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Sharp said he doesn't see a need for conflict. A&amp;M is a top-tier public university &mdash; it isn&rsquo;t competing with the regional schools when it moves into an area like the Rio Grande Valley, he said. Reaching students in those underserved areas benefits the whole state, he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anybody expands for the heck of it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You expand if there is a need and there is a reason that you are called.&rdquo;</p>

  headline: "If Cruz is Nominee, He Could Impact GOP's House Majority, Some Say"
  author: 'Abby Livingston'
  pub_date: 'Dec. 17, 2015'
  num_comments: '18'
  body: "<p dir='ltr'><span>WASHINGTON &mdash; The Republican Party sits on more seats in the&nbsp;U.S. House than at any point&nbsp;</span><a href='http://history.house.gov/Institution/Party-Divisions/Party-Divisions/'><span>since before the Great Depression</span></a><span>. And while losing that 58</span>-seat<span> majority in the 2016 election had been unthinkable</span><span>, Republicans worry that their control could be in jeopardy </span><a href='http://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/republicans-fear-trump-216561'><span>if the bombastic Donald Trump wins the GOP presidential nomination</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p dir='ltr'><span>But Democrats and political analysts say that a similar change in political fortunes could also follow </span><span>if U.S. Sen. </span><a href='http://www.texastribune.org/directory/ted-cruz/'><span>Ted Cruz</span></a><span>, himself a polarizing figure, is the Republican presidential nominee next fall. It's a notion that even several Republicans are slow to dismiss.</span></p>
<p dir='ltr'><span>While Cruz and Trump are enjoying success in running campaigns that appeal to the GOP base, some political experts and operatives say their messages could prove unpalatable to general election voters in dozens of GOP-held House districts in the Northeast and in some suburbs, where voters<span>&nbsp;are often fiscally conservative but socially liberal</span></span><span>.</span></p>
<p dir='ltr'><span>&ldquo;I think it has to play out, but there is nervousness with Cruz, who is clearly not part of the establishment, that you don&rsquo;t find with [Marco] Rubio or [Jeb] Bush or [John] Kasich in some of those districts,' said former U.S. Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., an expert on House races. He added that although Cruz could be a drag in the Northeast, where there are vulnerable incumbents from Pennsylvania to New England,&nbsp;and in upper Midwest states like Michigan, the Texan could also boost candidates in the western U.S., where Republicans are in tough Nevada and Colorado districts.<strong><span style='text-decoration: line-through;'><br /></span></strong></span></p>
<p dir='ltr'>Davis, however, cautioned that it is too early in the election to know which issues will drive voters to the polls next fall.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir='ltr'><span>The concern among Republicans over Cruz does not appear to be on par with that related to Trump, whose rhetoric on Mexico and Muslims earned him critics across the political spectrum. But both Republicans and Democrats say that Cruz on the ballot could still have far-reaching effects on the House map in a presidential election year, which traditionally sees stronger turnout from Democratic voters than midterm elections. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir='ltr'><span>Cruz is running a sharply conservative campaign based on the theory that he will energize evangelical voter<span style='text-decoration: line-through;'>s</span> <span style='text-decoration: line-through;'>to</span> turn out and overwhelm the margins that President Obama racked up in 2008 and 2012. </span></p>
<p dir='ltr'><span>Some House Republican campaign operatives worry that such a strategy would alienate voters in suburban Philadelphia, Chicago and Detroit and in upstate New York. </span></p>
<p dir='ltr'><span>&ldquo;If you have someone like Sen. Cruz, the members who are most vulnerable are in states like New York and Pennsylvania and swing states, and if you have a nominee who is widely out of step with voters in those states, there&rsquo;s no question that would be a recruiting tool for the Democrats,' said GOP consultant Brian Walsh.</span></p>
<p dir='ltr'><span>'The irony is that it is Republicans who are least aligned with Cruz who would pay the biggest price for the nomination,' he said of more moderate incumbents in suburban districts. </span></p>
<p dir='ltr'><span>Walsh, a former U.S. House and Senate staffer, would not subscribe to the House-is-in-play theory, arguing that even with substantial GOP losses, his party's majority is too large for Democrats to threaten.</span></p>
<p dir='ltr'><span>'Given where the maps are, Cruz would make the House interestingly competitive and worth pulling the calculator out of the drawer to count&nbsp;seat by seat,' said Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst with the Rothenberg/Gonzales Political Report. </span></p>
<p dir='ltr'><span>Rothenberg added that a Cruz or Trump nomination puts a vulnerable Republican incumbent in a Catch-22. A vulnerable Republican incumbent might&nbsp;aim to differentiate oneself from such a nominee, but 'doing that has a downside, too &mdash; you&rsquo;re going to alienate some Republicans if you are distancing yourself from the nominee,' he said. </span></p>
<p dir='ltr'><span>Campaign operatives from both parties point to the 26 GOP-held seats that are in districts where Obama won a majority of the 2012 popular vote. The Republican fear &mdash;&nbsp;and Democratic hope - is that Cruz falls short of 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney's performance and throws those seats into contention.</span></p>
<p dir='ltr'><span>A Cruz spokeswoman dismissed the entire notion, pointing to the party's successful 2014 midterm races. </span></p>
<p dir='ltr'><span>'When Congressional leadership had the chance to actually stand on principle and fight for something &mdash; defunding Obamacare, stopping amnesty, reigning in spending &mdash; they instead ran for the hills,' Catherine Frazier wrote in an email. 'Meanwhile, Ted Cruz made the election a referendum on these issues, and it&rsquo;s what every GOP candidate ran on when it came time to campaign.' </span></p>
<p dir='ltr'><span>'And because of that, Republicans won,' she added. 'The way Cruz wins the election is by energizing Republicans and then making the argument to independents and even Democrats for how his conservative principles are what will provide real opportunity and improve their lives.'</span></p>
<p dir='ltr'><span>But while the Cruz campaign rejects the idea, Democrats are actively making plans around a would-be Cruz or Trump nomination as they enter the final stretch of 2016 candidate recruitment.<span style='text-decoration: line-through;'><br /></span></span></p>
<p dir='ltr'><span>Several House Democratic sources said the party pitch to recruits shifted this fall: If there is any time to run for Congress, it's the year when Republicans are postured to run a controversial nominee. </span></p>
<p dir='ltr'><span>Their hope is to have candidates in place in the event Cruz or Trump is at the top of the ballot and the bottom falls out for downballot Republicans next November. </span></p>
<p dir='ltr'><span>'We&rsquo;ve have been actively recruiting in races across the country, but the farther the Republican presidential primary moves toward the fringes, the more clear the choice becomes for voters up and down the ballot,' said Matt Thornton, the spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the House&rsquo;s Democratic campaign arm. </span></p>
<p dir='ltr'><span>Thornton maintained that </span><span>competing in 70 new districts has been the strategy since the beginning of the cycle. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir='ltr'><span>Rothenberg called Democratic recruitment 'mixed,' but said that a polarizing Republican nominee 'could possibly make underwhelming Democratic recruits look more impressive and threatening.'</span></p>
<p dir='ltr'><span>U.S. Rep. Lois Frankel, D-Fla., who is active with the House&rsquo;s Democratic campaign arm, said that having any one of Cruz, Trump or retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson being the GOP nominee would be a boon to her party&rsquo;s recruitment. </span></p>
<p dir='ltr'><span>&ldquo;I have talked to candidates who are waiting to file if [the nomination] goes that way,&rdquo; Frankel said.</span></p>
<p dir='ltr'><span><span>Katie Martin, the spokeswoman for the House GOP's campaign arm, said the Democrats' hopes are flawed.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The significant holes in House Democrats' recruiting efforts not only proves that their confidence in riding Hillary's coattails is misplaced, but also that they have no hope of recapturing the House majority in 2016,' she said.</p>
<p dir='ltr'><span>Adding to the skepticism: the way districts are drawn in several states across the nation, giving Republicans an edge in those states. As such, many Democrats lost hope years ago that they would have a shot at regaining control of the House.</span></p>
<p dir='ltr'><span>Some Democratic members interviewed by the Tribune even rolled their eyes at the idea that a fallible Republican nominee could put the party in control. The margin is just too large, and they expect the election to be about national security, a traditional struggle for the Democratic Party. </span></p>
<p dir='ltr'><span>And Davis, the former congressman from Virginia, said that the Democrats&rsquo; presidential frontrunner, is polarizing in her own right. </span></p>
<p dir='ltr'><span>&ldquo;People have looked at Cruz&rsquo;s record and say it isn&rsquo;t mainstream in some areas. &hellip; There&rsquo;s always that fear in the swing districts that determine which party controls the House,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But Hillary Clinton is not that popular either.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir='ltr'><span>He said it is too early to speculate on what the &ldquo;issue matrix will be a year from now.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p dir='ltr'><span>U.S. Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla. who ran the House GOP campaign arm in 2008, didn&rsquo;t give voice to concerns about losing the House during an interview with The Texas Tribune. But he said presidential nominees clearly matter down-ballot. </span></p>
<p dir='ltr'><span>&ldquo;The most important single factor next year if you&rsquo;re a House member is going to be who&rsquo;s running at the top of the ticket, because the correlation between presidential and House votes today versus twenty, thirty years ago is just astronomically different,' he said. 'Our fate is very much tied to whoever our nominee is.'</span></p>"

  headline: 'Ted Cruz Jettisons Compromise on Immigration'
  author: 'Jay Root and Patrick Svitek'
  pub_date: 'Dec. 16, 2015'
  num_comments: '20'
  body: "<p>Listen to Republican presidential candidate <a href='http://www.texastribune.org/directory/ted-cruz/'>Ted Cruz</a> on immigration policy these days and there&rsquo;s little daylight between the firebrand senator and GOP frontrunner Donald Trump.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both in the deport-first-and-ask-questions-later camp.</p>
<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t always the case. In the summer of 2013, as Congress was mulling sweeping immigration reforms, Cruz was promoting a &ldquo;middle ground&rdquo; that would have dramatically boosted legal immigration and even given legal status and work permits to millions of undocumented immigrants already living in the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the proponents of this bill actually demonstrate a commitment not to politics, not to campaigning all the time, but to actually fixing this problem, to finding a middle ground, that would fix the problem and also allow for those 11 million people who are here illegally a legal status with citizenship off the table,&rdquo; Cruz said on the floor of the Senate in June 2013. &ldquo;I believe that is the compromise that can pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p><iframe width='560' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/yiL2H5y_5qU' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen=''></iframe></p>
<p>Later, in an extensive interview with The Texas Tribune, Cruz expressed frustration that the media wasn&rsquo;t covering his efforts to fix the nation&rsquo;s immigration woes because it didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;fit the narrative they&rsquo;re writing, which is Republicans are anti-immigrant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no stronger advocate of legal immigration in the Senate than I am,&rdquo; Cruz told the Tribune. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all the children of immigrants. I think that is the fundamental DNA of America.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A far different Ted Cruz has shown up on the campaign trail in recent weeks. Gone are the pledges to double legal immigration to 1.35 million people a year &mdash; up from 675,000 &mdash; and to eliminate the country-by-country caps that Cruz said at the time &ldquo;penalizes the nation of Mexico significantly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That proposal&nbsp;<a href='http://www.cruz.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=137' target='_blank'>included</a>&nbsp;a whopping fivefold increase in legal temporary work permits, known as H-1B visas.</p>
<p>Cruz jettisoned those increases weeks ago when he&nbsp;<a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/11/13/ted-cruz-unveils-immigration-plan-on-marco-rubios-home-turf/' target='_blank'>advocated for restrictions</a>&nbsp;on legal immigration until the economy improves and specifically called for a temporary moratorium on all H1-B visas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For weeks after that flip-flop, which was contained in his sweeping immigration campaign proposal, Cruz&nbsp;<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuupFByd-4o' target='_blank'>took heat</a>&nbsp;for repeatedly&nbsp;<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XFwpooE7q8' target='_blank'>refusing</a>&nbsp;to answer what he would do with the estimated 11 to 12 million undocumented immigrants who are in the country now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That nuance disappeared Tuesday at the Venetian Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas, where Cruz took the GOP debate&nbsp;stage as a top tier candidate for president and distanced himself from the positions he advocated as a newly minted U.S.&nbsp;senator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You enforce the law, and federal immigration law provides if someone is here illegally and is apprehended that they should be sent back to their home country,&rdquo; Cruz said during the debate. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s critical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cruz also tried to make a clean break from his own record, saying, &ldquo;I have never supported legalization, and I do not intend to support legalization.'&nbsp;After the debate, Cruz campaign chairman Chad Sweet made clear the senator was ruling out any form of legalization, telling reporters Cruz &ldquo;unequivocally&rdquo; opposes it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet during the August congressional&nbsp;recess of 2013, as Cruz held political events in Texas, he made it clear that &mdash; despite his Tea Party bonafides and his famous clashes with the GOP establishment &mdash; he wanted to help forge an immigration deal that could pass a divided Congress.</p>
<p>And that included legalization of those here without authorization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 2013 Tribune interview,&nbsp;Cruz repeatedly stressed that the changes he proposed to the so-called Gang of Eight immigration reform bill &mdash; which his GOP presidential&nbsp;rival, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, supported despite heavy criticism from conservatives &mdash; would have permitted millions of people here illegally to stay and work.</p>
<p>Cruz&rsquo;s allies have since argued that his proposals on the immigration legislation amounted to&nbsp;&nbsp;a &ldquo;poison pill,&rdquo; a legislative tactic meant to undermine support for legislation. But Cruz himself made clear both in the Tribune interview and in other public statements about the proposal that he was trying to help immigration reform pass, not keep it from passing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My objective was not to kill immigration reform but to amend the Gang of Eight bill so that it actually solves the problem rather than making the problem worse,&rdquo; Cruz told the Washington Examiner in May 2013.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong></p>
<p>As he explained his position to the Tribune<strong>&nbsp;</strong>during a ride from Kerrville to Austin on Aug. 21, 2013,&nbsp;Cruz left no doubt that undocumented immigrants would get work permits if his proposals were adopted.</p>
<p>He said his amendments 'did not alter the underlying language of the bill that would have allowed for legalization and indeed would have allowed for them to receive a green card.&rdquo; What it would not have done is put them on a pathway to citizenship, which Cruz has consistently maintained would be &nbsp;unfair to those who waited in line to immigrate legally to the U.S.</p>
<p>In that interview, Cruz said congressional Democrats &mdash; and he called out Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York in particular &mdash; knew they could never get a bill with a pathway to citizenship through Congress but were pushing it anyway&nbsp;for political reasons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most tellingly, he is willing to do nothing, zero, for the 11 million people who are here illegally, because what Sen. Schumer just said is if he doesn&rsquo;t get 100 percent of his partisan political objective, they can stay in the shadows, be denied legalization,&rdquo; Cruz told the Tribune. &ldquo;That is a profoundly cynical view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Asked if some might consider it amnesty to give immigrants legal status even though they came to the U.S.&nbsp;without papers, Cruz signaled that he&rsquo;d rather get a partial victory than nothing at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have said from the very beginning that I believe in compromise,&rdquo; Cruz told the Tribune. &ldquo;Ronald Reagan said, 'What do you do if you are offered half a loaf?' Answer? You take it.&nbsp;And then you come back for more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rubio, now one of Cruz&rsquo;s closest competitors for the GOP presidential&nbsp;nomination,&nbsp;has been working for weeks to show that Cruz's immigration views are not that different from his. Rubio supports a path to citizenship for people in the country illegally, a position he did not shy away from in the debate&nbsp;Tuesday&nbsp;night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anybody watching TV&nbsp;tonight&nbsp;didn&rsquo;t know what Marco Rubio&rsquo;s position on immigration was,&rdquo; Rubio spokesman Alex Conant told reporters after the debate. &ldquo;A lot of them still don&rsquo;t know what Ted Cruz&rsquo;s position on immigration is.&rdquo;</p>"

  headline: "Analysis: Budget Battle Might Seem Boring, But Don't Doubt Its Impact"
  author: 'Ross Ramsey'
  pub_date: 'Jan. 4, 2016'

  body: "<p>If you want to make big changes without raising too much attention, make them boring.</p>
<p>For an example, look at how some serious power over the state budget shifted from the Legislature to the governor. Taking his veto powers where previous governors have feared to go, Gov. <a href='http://www.texastribune.org/directory/greg-abbott/'>Greg Abbott</a> knocked out several spending items that state lawmakers had composed not as &ldquo;appropriations,&rdquo; but as &ldquo;informational items.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lawmakers&rsquo; idea, a common tactic in Texas state budgets, was that the spending part of a budget &mdash; the part where the governor&rsquo;s veto pen is a threat &mdash; is where the money is set aside. Everything else, as practice has it, is for informational purposes only.</p>
<p>Abbott <a href='http://www.texastribune.org/2015/07/22/analysis-challenge-vetoes-and-agovernors-power/'>challenged</a> that after the 2015 legislative session, vetoing some of the Legislature&rsquo;s spending plans by dipping into the fine print and saying the finance people couldn&rsquo;t block him with its use of &ldquo;magic words.&rdquo; Lt. Gov. <a href='http://www.texastribune.org/directory/dan-patrick/'>Dan Patrick</a> <a href='http://www.texastribune.org/2015/07/22/patrick-backs-abbott-line-item-veto-dispute/'>unexpectedly sided</a> with the governor instead of with his own senators. Comptroller Glenn Hegar was confounded enough to <a href='http://www.texastribune.org/2015/08/26/hegar-punts-abbott-vetoes-asks-ag-decide/'>ask the attorney general</a> for a legal opinion. And <a href='http://www.texastribune.org/directory/ken-paxton/'>Ken Paxton</a>, the AG, <a href='http://www.texastribune.org/2015/12/21/attorney-generals-office-abbotts-budget-vetoes-sho/'>opined</a> that the governor is right.</p>
<p>Paxton&rsquo;s opinion isn&rsquo;t a legal ruling; push can still come to shove. But for now, the governor is enjoying power over the budget that his predecessors never asserted.</p>
<p>Boring, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>It turns out that we are collectively dumb in ways that can be useful to people in positions of power. Go see or read 'The Big Short,' the Michael Lewis book and movie about the collapse of the financial markets and the housing industry. People who commit simple crimes get punished. People who commit complicated crimes get bonuses.</p>
<p>Why? Because holding up a convenience store is dramatic. Guns are involved. The whole thing can be played back on grainy security footage.</p>
<p>Stealing with a fountain pen is unremarkable to watch, even if the numbers involved have lots of commas in them.</p>
<p>But enough about crime. Let&rsquo;s get back to the Texas Legislature.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re supposed to think that legislators write the budgets and then control them. That&rsquo;s true, to a point. Some legislators write budgets, and everybody else goes along with the judgments of those budgeteers.</p>
<p>Most of them find budgets as boring as you probably do.</p>
<p>And most of them find enough to like in the state budget to ignore the parts that they don&rsquo;t like. Lawmakers from across the political spectrum vote in favor of things they oppose every time they vote on legislation as complex as a state budget. Each, for his or her own reasons, has to be at least 51 percent satisfied. Truth be told, most of them are more approving than that, but it&rsquo;s also true that almost all lawmakers can find millions of dollars in the budget that they&rsquo;d rather not spend.</p>
<p>The trick is that it&rsquo;s a different item of spending for each group of lawmakers.</p>
<p>A governor has a much freer hand &mdash; especially if Abbott&rsquo;s interpretation, bolstered by Paxton, survives any challenges.</p>
<p>Abbott has a line-item veto, meaning he can strike any single item from a budget that he doesn&rsquo;t like. This legislative trick of using line items is designed to thwart governors. If you put all of the funding for a university in one line and then list the services the school should provide without numbers, the governor can either keep the whole school or lose the whole school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, no governor has been so bold.</p>
<p>But lawmakers also want to hold the agencies of government accountable. They like to make sure money is spent the way they want it spent. It forces them to be specific, even in their so-called informational items, and the more specific they get, the more they expose themselves to vetoes.</p>
<p>Several targets of Abbott&rsquo;s vetoes had dollar amounts attached to them, and have helped him make the case that those were, as the lawyers put it, &ldquo;Items of Appropriation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eyes glazing over a bit? That could be a sign that something momentous is going on. Instead of talking about how many people get what kind of nursing home care or whether police officers have solid pensions or whether the schools are great or good or fair or poor, they can talk about numbers, items of appropriation, informational items and whether the governor can or cannot have a meaningful say in how the state operates.</p>
<p>Budgets are not just piles of boring numbers. If you pay attention, they are the government&rsquo;s operating instructions. This is an argument about who gets to write them.</p>"

  headline: "One Year, Two Races: Inside the GOP's Bizarre, Tumultuous 2015"

<div></div>
<p><i>It is an oppressively humid day in South Florida and Jeb Bush has come home to declare his candidacy for president. The big crowd assembled at Miami Dade College is festive &mdash; and diverse, reflecting the culture of Miami that has shaped the former governor for decades and the kind of openness he believes his party needs to win the White House. Bush has had a difficult spring, his candidacy buffeted by criticism and self-inflicted wounds. But in many circles he is still seen as the politician to beat for the Republican nomination.</i></p>
<p><i>His speech evokes what he hopes voters will see in him, someone with executive experience, conservative values and a reformer&rsquo;s instinct &mdash; and perhaps above all, electability.&nbsp;</i><i>&ldquo;I will take nothing and no one for granted,&rdquo; he says. The speech draws strong reviews, his best moment yet. For Bush, it is a day to put his problems behind him and begin the campaign anew.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>June 16, 2015</strong></p>
<p><i>The scene at Trump Tower on New York&rsquo;s Fifth Avenue is surreal. Down the escalator, his image reflecting on the walls around the lobby, comes Donald Trump, the billionaire developer and reality TV star. The crowd gathered in the lobby is large and boisterous. Later it will be revealed that some were paid to attend &mdash; an arrangement the candidate would not long need.</i></p>
<p><i>Trump is there to announce, to the surprise of so many, that he will seek the White House. He has flirted with this before but always stopped short. Now he says he is in. His speech is seemingly off the cuff. He goes after China and President Obama and then turns to immigration. Mexico is sending their worst across the border, he says &mdash; drug dealers, rapists and murderers among them. The language is harsh &mdash; shocking to many &mdash; and draws instant condemnations. For the novice politician, it is an inauspicious start to the campaign.</i></p>
<p>The year 2015 will be remembered as one of the most&nbsp;bizarrely compelling and yet genuinely unnerving in the nation&rsquo;s modern political history.</p>
<p>It is clear now that there were two halves to the year for the Republican Party: BT and AT, Before Trump and After Trump. From January to mid-June the story of the Republican race was mostly conventional, with Bush the focal point for good and ill. There were unanticipated twists, among them the sheer size of the field of candidates &mdash; ultimately a total of 17 who would formally declare.</p>
<p>Those early months, however, were only a prelude to the real events that would follow. It is hardly overstatement to say that, on June 16, everything changed &mdash; though no one knew it at the time, not even Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s entry brought scorn and dismissal. He was a clown, a carnival barker, the leading man in a sideshow with a short run. His outrageous rhetoric &mdash; an appeal to nativism and antipathy toward everything from institutional powers to cultural shifts &mdash; seemed to guarantee all that.</p>
<p>Yet even on that day in June there were signs that the elites in the party and in the political community didn&rsquo;t get what was stirring. From New York, Trump flew to Iowa for a rally at Hoyt Sherman Auditorium in Des Moines, where he was cheered as he strode down the aisle to the front stage.</p>
<p>Don and Kathy Watson were among those who had come to see him. Asked why Trump, she replied: &ldquo;Why not? He&rsquo;s as good as anybody. .&thinsp;.&thinsp;. He&rsquo;s not afraid. He&rsquo;s not a politician.&rdquo; They weren&rsquo;t certain they would support Trump, but they knew which candidate they would not support: Bush. &ldquo;Dump him. We&rsquo;ve had too many Bushes,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s reception that night showed that whatever the party establishment thought of him, many voters found him instantly attractive. Those early sentiments underscored the festering emotions that would soon burst forth, frustrations born of economic stress and disgust with Washington.</p>
<p>By the end of the year, every candidate running for the nomination could sense it &mdash; and all were trying to adapt, channeling the anger as best they could. Some adapted well, and may yet win the nomination. Others didn&rsquo;t make it to the New Year.</p>
<p>Aboard his campaign bus in Iowa two days before the arrival of 2016, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida reflected on what he had seen and felt through the amazing year of 2015.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People are just tired,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve tried Democrats, they&rsquo;ve tried Republicans. They&rsquo;ve tried a combination of both. They&rsquo;ve tried new people, they&rsquo;ve tried old people and nothing changes. Things get worse. They don&rsquo;t seem to get better, no matter who&rsquo;s in charge; it feels like the country is stuck in neutral and people are fed up and that&rsquo;s what brings us to the point where we&rsquo;re at today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What Rubio said was an echo of what almost every Republican candidate was saying by the end of the year. But as the election year opens, the lingering question &mdash; the big unknown &mdash; is whether 2015 will prove to be an aberration, a holiday from reality or a portent of things to come.</p>
<p>What is clearest is what didn&rsquo;t work in 2015, though it often worked in the past. Television advertising moved few voters. Policy rollouts fell on deaf ears. Impressive political r&eacute;sum&eacute;s proved not to be persuasive. What took on the Republican side was a new kind of politics, one built on emotion and visceral connection. To some people, this represented a worrying turn toward a darker and more divisive politics. To others, it was a welcome turn away from what they considered to be too much political correctness.</p>
<p>Rick Santorum said of Trump: &ldquo;He may have understood the game better than any of us.&rdquo; But like so many people, the former senator from Pennsylvania wondered whether the billionaire mogul understands the game ahead. It is the question that hovers over everything in politics at this moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the vote is much different than a poll and so I want to see what happens when people actually vote,&rdquo; New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said in evaluating 2015. &ldquo;Then we can start talking about eras being defined or newly established.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer will come soon enough. What follows is the story of how Republicans got to where they are today, told primarily through the impressions, recollections and analyses of those who lived it personally &mdash; the Republican candidates. This article is based almost entirely on on-the-record interviews with most of the major candidates &mdash; some of whom fell away &mdash; and with their advisers and other strategists. It is the story of a remarkable year in American politics.</p>
<p><span>The question that hovered over the Republican Party a year ago was very different: Will he or won&rsquo;t he?</span></p>
<p>In late 2014, the he in question was Jeb Bush. A son and brother of presidents. A towering figure in Florida politics. A cerebral executive celebrated for his policy chops and conservative record as governor. Though hobbled by his support for immigration reform and Common Core educational standards, Bush was seen by party elites as a man literally groomed for the office &mdash; a president at the ready.</p>
<p>The reality would prove to be more complicated.&nbsp;Out of office for eight years, Bush was rusty, and through the fights of the Obama era that reordered the political right, he was largely absent.</p>
<p>To demonstrate that he was in touch with politics in the age of social media, Bush went on Facebook on Dec. 17 to declare that he was actively exploring a run. The announcement landed like a thunderclap, instantly thrusting him to the top and undercutting a slew of other establishment hopefuls, especially Christie and Rubio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any time someone with the last name Bush gets into a national race, the first impact you feel is fundraising, and that&rsquo;s certainly the one that we felt most immediately,&rdquo; Christie would later recall. &ldquo;A lot of people started to sign on with him before we&rsquo;d even gotten off the ground. It was his attempt, I think, to preempt the field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally Bradshaw, senior adviser to the Bush campaign, said there was no expectation of clearing the field &mdash; quite the opposite. &ldquo;We knew this would be a more crowded and talented field than 2012 and we knew the electorate was angry at President Obama,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We assumed there would be an establishment candidate or several and an anger candidate.&nbsp;Our assumption was that [the anger candidate] would be Ted Cruz.&nbsp;No one anticipated a Trump candidacy at that point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bush&rsquo;s aggressive effort to raise funds in early 2015, Bradshaw said, reflected the campaign team&rsquo;s assumption that the nomination contest would be highly competitive and potentially lengthy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shock and awe&rdquo; is how it came to be called, to the chagrin of Bradshaw and others. Still, it was a genuine blitzkrieg. Bush&rsquo;s advisers established Right to Rise, a super PAC that could accept unlimited contributions, and it vacuumed up big checks by the day. On Jan. 9, it received its first $1 million contribution, from Los Angeles investment banker Brad Freeman. By February, Bush was averaging one fundraiser a day and regularly headlining events with a minimum price tag of $100,000 a person, such as the Feb. 11 gathering at the Park Avenue home of private-equity titan Henry Kravis.</p>"
