  headline: 'GOP Leaders Mostly Silent on Abbott Plan to Amend Constitution'

  body: "<p>Three days after Gov. <a href='http://www.texastribune.org/directory/greg-abbott/'>Greg Abbott</a> called for a convention of states to<strong>&nbsp;</strong>amend the U.S. Constitution, his fellow&nbsp;high-ranking Republicans in Texas &mdash; typically quick to chime in with support for the governor &mdash; have kept uncharacteristically quiet about&nbsp;the&nbsp;proposal.</p>
<p>Abbott&nbsp;received a standing ovation at a conservative think tank's conference&nbsp;on Friday after he&nbsp;<a href='https://www.texastribune.org/2016/01/08/abbott-calls-states-amend-us-constitution/'>unveiled nine proposed amendments</a> to the U.S. Constitution, intended to bolster states&rsquo; rights while reining in the powers of Congress and the federal government.&nbsp;The governor predicted a majority of Americans would support amending the Constitution to&nbsp;require Congress pass a balanced federal budget&nbsp;and allow states&nbsp;to override federal laws and U.S. Supreme Court decisions.</p>
<p>Yet outside of the Hilton ballroom in Austin, Abbott's proposal has not drawn the same instant praise. Several <span style='line-height: 1.35;'>GOP state leaders including Lt. Gov. </span><a style='line-height: 1.35;' href='http://www.texastribune.org/directory/dan-patrick/'>Dan Patrick</a><span style='line-height: 1.35;'> and House Speaker </span><a style='line-height: 1.35;' href='http://www.texastribune.org/directory/joe-straus/'>Joe Straus</a><span style='line-height: 1.35;'> have yet to weigh in on the proposal.&nbsp;</span>Neither representatives for Patrick nor Straus responded to questions from The Texas Tribune Monday.<span style='text-decoration: line-through;'><br /></span></p>
<p>Cynthia Meyer, Texas Attorney General <a href='http://www.texastribune.org/directory/ken-paxton/'>Ken Paxton</a>'s spokeswoman,&nbsp;suggested Paxton believed Abbott's amendments &ldquo;ought to be considered&rdquo; but stopped short of confirming he supports Abbott's proposal for a constitutional convention.</p>
<hr><form action='https://texastribune.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=3d0ce87edeeb6df90043897db&amp;id=68501b81bf' method='post' target='_blank' class='signup'><h2>Sign Up for The Brief</h2><p>Our daily news summary</p><input type='email' value='' name='EMAIL' placeholder='Email'><input type='submit' value='Submit' name='subscribe'></form>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps this bold call causes Congress and the courts to listen to the American people and return their focus to a limited government,&rdquo;&nbsp;Meyer said.</p>
<p>The ambivalence among many Republican officials underscores the divisions among conservative grassroots about how Abbott proposed for the U.S. Constitution to be amended.&nbsp;<span style='line-height: 1.35;'>The standard method for making changes requires a two-thirds vote from both chambers of Congress. Each of the document&rsquo;s 27 existing amendments was approved that way.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>But the Constitution also permits a second, unrealized method for passing amendments. If 34 states ask for a constitutional convention, delegates may meet to consider changes to the Constitution &mdash;&nbsp;which could then become law if they had the support of at least 38 states.&nbsp;In 2015, the Texas House passed a<a href='http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=84R&amp;Bill=HJR77'>&nbsp;bill</a>&nbsp;calling for such a convention but it failed to pass out of the Senate.</p>
<p>Critics say this method would risk leading to a &ldquo;runaway&rdquo; convention, where states could radically alter the document that forms the backbone of U.S. governance. Abbott has said those concerns are without merit.</p>
<p><span style='line-height: 1.35;'>After the governor&rsquo;s speech on Friday, at least one elected Texas Republican suggested disagreement with Abbott's plan.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The Constitution is not the problem,&rdquo; wrote state Rep. <a href='http://www.texastribune.org/directory/david-simpson/'>David Simpson</a>, R-Longview, on his <a href='https://www.facebook.com/DavidSimpsonTX/posts/10153294746926404'>Facebook page</a>. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s elected officials that won&rsquo;t stand up and enforce the strict limitations it imposes on the role of government both in Washington and Austin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Simpson is running for the Texas Senate. A spokesman for his chief opponent in that race, state Rep. <a href='http://www.texastribune.org/directory/bryan-hughes/'>Bryan Hughes</a>, R-Mineola, did not respond to a request for comment on his position about Abbott&rsquo;s proposal.</p>
<p>One of the strongest supporters of Abbott's plan, state Rep.&nbsp;<a href='http://www.texastribune.org/directory/paul-workman/'>Paul Workman</a>, R-Austin, has pledged to pass the proposal in the next legislative session.</p>
<p>'I have committed my full support to the governor in making sure Texas takes the lead in restoring the rights of the states and putting our country back on track,' Workman&nbsp;<a href='http://tribtalk.org/2016/01/11/time-for-texas-to-take-the-lead-in-amending-the-us-constitution/'>wrote in&nbsp;</a><a href='http://tribtalk.org/2016/01/11/time-for-texas-to-take-the-lead-in-amending-the-us-constitution/'>&nbsp;TribTalk</a>, the Tribune&rsquo;s&nbsp;op-ed site.&nbsp;'Now is the time for a convention of states.'</p>
<p>Across the aisle, Texas Democrats lambasted Abbott&rsquo;s call for a constitutional convention, calling it an attempt by an &ldquo;imperial&rdquo; governor to &ldquo;tear apart the Constitution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Texas families deserve serious solutions, not Tea Party nonsense,&rdquo; said Texas Democratic Party Deputy Director Manny Garcia.</p>
<p>Yet the Tea Party is&nbsp;far from united&nbsp;on the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Julie McCarty, president of the NE Tarrant Tea Party, a prominent conservative group, said she personally opposed the idea but that her group has &ldquo;participants on both sides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Texas conservative grassroots have come a long way in educating ourselves and building our influence, but this is not something we are ready for until our numbers are much bigger, our influence is much stronger, and frankly, not until we take seriously our need for much more education on the role of government and how it should work,&rdquo; she wrote in an email.</p>
<p><span style='line-height: 1.35;'>That view was shared by Konni Burton, formerly of the NE Tarrant Tea Party and now a Republican state Senator from Colleyville, in 2011, when then-Texas Gov. </span><a style='line-height: 1.35;' href='http://www.texastribune.org/directory/rick-perry/'>Rick Perry</a><span style='line-height: 1.35;'>&nbsp;called on state lawmakers to endorse a constitutional convention for a federal balanced budget amendment. Lawmakers that year failed to pass a law calling for a convention.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Burton at the time told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that such a convention could allow 'anyone to offer up any number of amendments ... based on their own ideology and interests, which could ultimately radically change our Constitution.'</p>
<p>A spokesman for Burton did not return multiple requests for comment since Friday&nbsp;about whether her views on a constitutional convention<strong>&nbsp;</strong>had changed.</p>
<p>Randy Barnett, a constitutional law professor at Georgetown University who <a href='http://www.conventionofstates.com/the_jefferson_statement'>supports a convention of states</a>, said conservative groups like the Eagle Forum and John Birch Society have historically opposed the proposal, but that their fears of a runaway convention were &ldquo;based on a misreading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst thing that could ever happen is that the convention would propose amendments that would be beyond whatever scope they were supposedly given, and then three-quarters of the states would have to approve them,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Even&nbsp;U.S. Sen.&nbsp;<a href='http://www.texastribune.org/directory/ted-cruz/'>Ted Cruz</a>, a longtime Abbott ally who worked&nbsp;under Abbott when Abbott was attorney general, has suggested he may support a constitutional convention in the future but has not gone as far as Abbott on the issue.&nbsp;Campaigning last year in Iowa,&nbsp;Cruz,&nbsp;a Republican presidential candidate,&nbsp;<a href='http://www.texastribune.org/2015/06/28/court-decisions-give-cruz-new-ammo-old-targets/'>predicted</a>&nbsp;there would be 'more and more movement' toward a convention if Congress did not act on constitutional amendments.</p>
<p>On this issue, Abbott may be more aligned with one of Cruz's rivals&nbsp;for the GOP presidential nomination. Last week,&nbsp;U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio from Florida called for a constitutional convention in an op-ed published <a href='http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/01/06/marco-rubio-constitutional-convention-editorials-debates/78368672/'>in USA Today</a>.</p>"

  body: "<h2>The Big Conversation</h2>
<p>A week after <strong>Donald Trump</strong> decided to make <strong>Ted Cruz</strong>'s Canadian birth an issue in the GOP presidential primary race, the issue just won't seem to go away.</p>
<p>On Monday, Iowa Gov. <strong>Terry Branstad</strong> became the latest to say questions about Cruz <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/01/11/iowa-governor-branstad-knocks-cruz-on-canadian-birth/'>are 'fair game,'</a> joining others such as GOP presidential rival <strong>Rand Paul</strong> and Senate critic&nbsp;<strong>John McCain</strong> in keeping the issue alive.</p>
<p>For his part, Trump has continued to raise the issue in recent days. <em>The Washington Post</em> referred to a rally on Sunday <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/01/11/iowa-governor-branstad-knocks-cruz-on-canadian-birth/'>where the following happened</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Is he a natural-born citizen?' he asked several thousand people gathered in a ballroom. Members of the crowd shouted back, 'No!'</p>
<p>'I don't know,' Trump said. 'Honestly, we don't know. Who the hell knows.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cruz has consistently called the matter of his eligibility to serve 'settled law' as his mother was a U.S. citizen even though he was born on foreign soil. Presidential candidates such as McCain or <strong>Barry Goldwater</strong> were born in U.S. territories and considered 'natural born citizens.' But <strong>George Romney</strong> never got far enough in the 1968 primary contest for the matter of his Mexican birth to U.S. parents to be definitively settled.</p>

<p>As the <em>Fort Worth Star-Telegram</em> reported, Cruz has decided to present the controversy <a href='http://www.star-telegram.com/news/nation-world/national/article54014960.html'>as evidence of his rising status in the nomination fight</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three weeks ago, almost every Republican candidate was attacking Donald Trump,&rdquo; said Cruz. &ldquo;Today, almost every Republican candidate is attacking me. That kind of suggests maybe something has changed in the race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cruz also pushed back against Branstad's comments, noting that the Iowa governor's son is supporting <strong>Chris Christie</strong> for president. Also, <strong>Eric Branstad</strong> is the state director for America's Renewable Future, <a href='http://www.texastribune.org/2016/01/06/iowa-cruz-confronts-politics-ethanol/'>a pro-ethanol group that has been sparring with Cruz</a> over his opposition to the federal government setting a minimum amount of ethanol to be blended into the U.S. fuel supply.</p>
<p><a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/01/11/iowa-governor-branstad-knocks-cruz-on-canadian-birth/'>The Post wrote</a>, 'Branstad's son 'is leading the effort of lobbyists and Democrats to run attack ads against our campaign because they're supporting a more moderate candidate,' (Cruz) said. 'They&rsquo;re entitled to do that and they&rsquo;re entitled to engage in whatever attacks they want. It's the nature of politics.''</p>

  headline: 'Oncor Airs Concerns with Ray Hunt Takeover Plan'

  body: "<p>Top officials at Oncor, Texas&rsquo; largest electric utility, aired concerns on Monday&nbsp;about Dallas billionaire<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Ray L. Hunt&rsquo;s $18 billion proposal to take over and reshape their company.</p>
<p>The testimony came as the Texas Public Utility Commission kicked off hearings on Hunt&rsquo;s effort to transform Oncor into a &ldquo;real estate investment trust,&rdquo; which is the lynchpin of efforts by Oncor&rsquo;s parent, Energy Future Holdings, to emerge from one of the largest bankruptcies in American history.</p>
<p>In hearings that could stretch into next week, the commission&rsquo;s three, governor-appointed members are charged with weighing the interests of the Hunts<strong> &mdash; </strong>who have deep roots in the Texas energy world&nbsp;<strong>&mdash; </strong>with those of Texas ratepayers and the electric grid.</p>
<p><span style='line-height: 1.35;'>Testifying in front on of state regulators, Oncor CEO Bob Shapard suggested that Hunt's plan </span><span style='line-height: 1.35;'>could leave the hulking utility </span><span style='line-height: 1.35;'>without </span>the<strong style='line-height: 1.35;'>&nbsp;</strong><span style='line-height: 1.35;'>flexibility to</span><span style='line-height: 1.35;'>&nbsp;smoothly handle unplanned events, such as a drop in revenue or major storms.</span></p>
<hr><form action='https://texastribune.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=3d0ce87edeeb6df90043897db&amp;id=68501b81bf' method='post' target='_blank' class='signup'><h2>Sign Up for The Brief</h2><p>Our daily news summary</p><input type='email' value='' name='EMAIL' placeholder='Email'><input type='submit' value='Submit' name='subscribe'></form>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re operating a major utility on a fraction of the economics we have today,&rdquo; he said of Hunt's bid for Oncor, whose transmission and distribution lines deliver power to more than 3 million Texas homes and businesses in North and West Texas.</p>
<p>Shapard also expressed concerns that the deal as written could jeopardize the utility&rsquo;s credit rating.&nbsp;If Hunt does not address those misgivings, the CEO said he<strong>&nbsp;</strong>would not recommend that state<strong>&nbsp;</strong>regulators approve the sale.</p>
<p><strong style='line-height: 1.35;'>A complicated plan</strong></p>
<p>A Delaware bankruptcy court has&nbsp;<a href='http://www.texastribune.org/2015/12/03/judge-approves-energy-futures-plan-emerge-huge-ban/'>already approved Energy Future Holdings&rsquo; plan</a>&nbsp;to shed $42 billion in debt. But Texas regulators still need to sign off on the Oncor sale, the bankruptcy deal's biggest piece.</p>
<p>With thick binders on hand for reference in the crowded hearing room, the regulators heard the intricate details of a complicated<strong>&nbsp;</strong>plan that the Hunts say fits the public interest &mdash; even though the business structure they are proposing has never been tried for a utility this big.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consumer advocates call the plan<strong>&nbsp;</strong>risky.&nbsp;Other critics include big electricity users, staff experts at the Public Utility Commission <a href='http://www.texastribune.org/2016/01/08/perry-takes-issue-hunts-huge-oncor-plan/'>and, in a surprise twist last week, former Gov. Rick Perry</a>.</p>
<p>The Hunts have pushed back, calling the concerns<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;alarmist and misguided.&rdquo; The family &mdash; with its respected name and business acumen &mdash; is well-positioned to run Oncor and help deliver Energy Future Holdings from its messy bankruptcy, it argues.</p>
<p>The plan 'resolves one of the most complex bankruptcies in history,&rdquo; James Bushee, an attorney for Hunt's acquisition company, said.&nbsp;&ldquo;The transaction would retain local control over Oncor ... This is not just a financial transaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span style='line-height: 1.35;'>To save on federal income taxes, Hunt wants to reorganize Oncor into a real estate investment trust, essentially dividing it into two companies: one owning the assets (power lines, trucks and transformers, for instance) while the other rents the equipment, operates it and deals with customers.</span></p>
<p>Current plans call for Oncor&rsquo;s &ldquo;asset&rdquo; company to hold some 97 percent of the utility&rsquo;s net income, which would go largely untaxed. The &ldquo;operating&rdquo; company would hold the rest. The two sides would negotiate equipment leases every few years.</p>
<p>The trust would be required to pay out at least 90 percent of its taxable income to shareholders thorough dividends. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>That financial structure has long served the real estate world. Shopping malls, for instance, commonly use it, as investors back a broad entity that rents space and other assets to individual stores.</p>
<p>The structure would initially help Oncor borrow money at lower rates, which the Hunt family says would help keep&nbsp;the utility financially healthy and potentially lead to lower rates in the long run.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s nearly unprecedented in the energy world. Hunt owns the only other U.S. utility organized in such a trust: Sharyland Utilities, which serves just 50,000 customers in&nbsp;<a href='http://1op2ep3s2jsaoeg8a36pkogmht.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SU_Service_Map_wTerritories-3.19.15.pdf'>small patches of rural West and North Texas</a>&nbsp;and has the highest rates in the state.</p>
<p>Hunt calls that experiment a success. Critics aren&rsquo;t so sure.</p>
<p>Several other aspects of the idea have prompted questions, including whether Oncor will be protected from the debt of its new parent, as it was when Energy Future Holdings&nbsp;sank.</p>
<p>The Hunts promise that Oncor&rsquo;s rates &mdash; which are among the lowest in the state &mdash; would not go up under the deal.</p>
<p>Opponents, however, say the more pressing question is whether the Hunts would pass Oncor's tax savings onto consumers directly, by cutting rates accordingly.&nbsp;The current proposal does not call for such a rate cut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The issue is not whether Oncor ratepayers will pay higher rates. The issue is whether rates are just and reasonable,&rdquo; testified Sam Chang, a Public Utility Commission attorney.&nbsp;&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to take a deduction, reflect that in rates.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Oncor&rsquo;s concerns</strong></p>
<p>Oncor has a solid relationship with the Hunts &mdash; their respective Dallas headquarters are<strong>&nbsp;</strong>across the street from each other &mdash; and the Hunts have alleviated some of Oncor's concerns in recent months, Shapard, the CEO, testified.</p>
<p>They have tentatively agreed to&nbsp;ensure that&nbsp;Oncor can cover more than $2 billion in employee pension liabilities, which had previously been in doubt. The Hunts have also agreed to set aside $500 million that Oncor operators could tap if they ran into unexpected expenses &mdash; like costly storms &mdash; in between their lease negotiations.</p>
<p>But Shapard said the Hunts have provided few details on how that fund would work, and much of the relationship between Oncor&rsquo;s &ldquo;asset &ldquo;and &ldquo;operating&rdquo; companies remains &ldquo;fairly undefined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The utility is &ldquo;going to rely on this commission to adequately protect Oncor,&rdquo; Shapard told regulators on Monday.</p>
<p><span>If the regulators reject Hunt's plan or add major stipulations, Energy Future Holdings<strong>&nbsp;</strong>could be thrust back into bankruptcy negotiations that cost it an estimated $1 million a day in legal fees.&nbsp;</span></p>

  headline: 'Beyond Iowa, Cruz Betting Heavily on South'

  body: "<p><span style='line-height: 1.35;'>WASHINGTON &mdash; In the more than 200 events he's held&nbsp;since launching his campaign for the White House 10 months ago, <a href='http://www.texastribune.org/directory/ted-cruz/'>Ted Cruz</a> has tested&nbsp;out an unorthodox strategy, one that could rewrite the rules of Republican presidential politics.</span></p>
<p class='p1'><span class='s1'>Since the Texas senator declared his candidacy in March, 40 percent of his public events have taken place in Iowa,&nbsp;according to a Texas Tribune analysis of&nbsp;<a href='http://apps.texastribune.org/tedtracker/'>his travel schedule</a>&nbsp;as of Saturday.&nbsp;But beyond that first-test state, Cruz has&nbsp;held nearly a quarter of&nbsp;his campaign events in the so-called&nbsp;&ldquo;SEC&nbsp;primary' states,&nbsp;a mostly southern mix of states that will host their primaries on March 1.</span></p>
<p class='p1'><span class='s1'>That&nbsp;breaks with&nbsp;tradition in GOP primary fights. In the past, presidential&nbsp;candidates&nbsp;poured&nbsp;almost all of their resources into Iowa, New Hampshire or South Carolina, the three earliest primary contests.&nbsp;</span></p>
<hr><form action='https://texastribune.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=3d0ce87edeeb6df90043897db&amp;id=68501b81bf' method='post' target='_blank' class='signup'><h2>Sign Up for The Brief</h2><p>Our daily news summary</p><input type='email' value='' name='EMAIL' placeholder='Email'><input type='submit' value='Submit' name='subscribe'></form>
<p class='p1'><span class='s1'>While other candidates are increasing their focus on those March 1 states, Cruz appears to be pursuing that strategy more aggressively, according to&nbsp;several people who have been following the campaigns.</span></p>
<p class='p1'><span class='s1'>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen anyone focus on the South the way that Cruz has,&rdquo;&nbsp;said former Republican National Committee spokesman Doug Heye. </span></p>
<p class='p1'><span class='s1'>Heye&nbsp;said that's a reflection of Cruz's keen&nbsp;understanding of&nbsp;the changes to this year's primary schedule.&nbsp;</span><span class='s1'>Republicans have&nbsp;added three southern&nbsp;states &mdash; Alabama, Arkansas and delegate-rich Texas &mdash; to the March 1, or&nbsp;Super Tuesday,&nbsp;lineup, while subtracting&nbsp;a handful of northern states. The net result is increased nominating power concentrated in the South&nbsp;at a pivotal point in the primary schedule.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class='p1'><span style='line-height: 1.35;'>'We certainly have had Super Tuesdays before, but the way this lines up with the scheduled states in play and where a particular candidate could have a very strong day with a very strong impact has all come at the same time,' Heye said.</span></p>
<p class='p1'><span style='line-height: 1.35;'>The Texas&nbsp;Tribune assembled a database of 241 Cruz campaign events: 235 he has&nbsp;appeared at since launching his bid for the White House, and a handful of events scheduled in the future.&nbsp;</span><span class='s1' style='line-height: 1.35;'>That count only includes candidate forums, debates and campaign-sponsored events open to the press. It does not include&nbsp;private fundraisers or events Cruz attended in his official capacity as a U.S. senator.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class='p2'><span class='s1'><span style='line-height: 1.35;'>Nothing illustrates how much is riding on Iowa for Cruz more than his travel schedule. The senator spent about 40 percent of his time on the trail in the Hawkeye State, everywhere from book signings to church services to a stop at a tractor store. Only 25 percent of his trips have taken him to New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina,&nbsp;the next three states on the primary calendar.</span></span></p>
<div id='pym-graphic'>&nbsp;</div>
<p class='p2'><span class='s1'>Cruz&nbsp;made more campaign trips to Des Moines, Iowa's largest city, than anywhere else in the country. But he's also made multiple trips to smaller communities that campaign officials view as pivotal&nbsp;to performing well in the state's Republican caucus. On Saturday, Cruz completed a six-day bus tour of Iowa with stops in 28 towns, including his fifth visit&nbsp;to Sioux City, a conservative bastion that&nbsp;<a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ted-cruz-promises-conservative-iowa-something-its-never-had-a-nominee/2016/01/06/fdb88a24-b477-11e5-a842-0feb51d1d124_story.html'>helped deliver a 2008 caucus win</a>&nbsp;to former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class='p2'><span class='s1'>That focus has&nbsp;paid off: He is now the frontrunner in Iowa with less than a month to go before the Feb. 1 caucus.</span></p>
<p class='p2'><span class='s1'>Recent history has shown&nbsp;that an Iowa win does not assure a Republican nomination.&nbsp;The last Iowa victor to secure the GOP nomination in an open race was George W. Bush in 2000.&nbsp;Cruz and his team are open about their aim to replicate the long game Democrat Barack Obama successfully deployed against Hillary Clinton there&nbsp;in the 2008 Democratic nomination fight.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class='p1'><span class='s1'><span class='s1' style='line-height: 1.35;'><span class='s1' style='line-height: 1.35;'>After the Iowa caucus and subsequent&nbsp;contests in New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina comes March 1, when any Republicans left standing will</span></span></span><span class='s1'>&nbsp;compete for 624 delegates across 12 states,&nbsp;compared to the 133 delegates up for grabs in&nbsp;the earlier states.</span></p>
<p><span class='s1' style='line-height: 1.35;'>Cruz has&nbsp;held&nbsp;24 percent of his events&nbsp;thus far in March 1 states&nbsp;&mdash; Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and&nbsp;Wyoming</span><span class='s1' style='line-height: 1.35;'>.&nbsp;</span><span class='s1' style='line-height: 1.35;'>Cruz signaled his focus on those states early on by kicking off his campaign with a speech </span><span class='s1' style='line-height: 1.35;'>at Liberty University in Virginia.&nbsp;</span><span style='line-height: 1.35;'>He has since made at least one stop in nearly all of those states.</span></p>
<p class='p1'><span class='s1'><span style='line-height: 1.35;'><span style='line-height: 1.35;'>It&rsquo;s a tactic that many Republicans are beginning to say might carry Cruz to the general election.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p class='p1'><span class='s1'>'If Cruz is able to do really well in the SEC primary, with the rationale that his campaign has talked about privately and he has talked about publicly,' said Heye, the former RNC staffer, 'this would go a long way with him getting the nomination.&rdquo;</span>&nbsp;</p>"

  headline: "DPS, Trooper Move to Halt Lawsuit by Sandra Bland's Family"

  body: "<p>The Texas Department of Public Safety and indicted trooper Brian Encinia want a federal judge to let the officer's criminal case in Waller County play out before moving forward with a lawsuit filed by Sandra Bland's mother.</p>
<p>Bland's case drew national attention after Encinia stopped her near the Prairie View A&amp;M University campus on July 10 for failing to properly signal a lane change. After a heated argument, Encinia arrested Bland for assaulting a public servant. Bland was found hanged in her Waller County jail cell three days later, and her death has been ruled a suicide.</p>
<p>Encinia is facing a perjury charge after a Waller County grand jury concluded Wednesday that there was evidence the officer lied about how Bland exited her car. Attorneys for Encinia and the state say the lawsuit filed by Bland's mother could interfere with the officer's right to a fair trial.</p>
<hr><form action='https://texastribune.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=3d0ce87edeeb6df90043897db&amp;id=68501b81bf' method='post' target='_blank' class='signup'><h2>Sign Up for The Brief</h2><p>Our daily news summary</p><input type='email' value='' name='EMAIL' placeholder='Email'><input type='submit' value='Submit' name='subscribe'></form>
<p>Texas Assistant Attorney General Seth Byron Dennis said in court papers filed Friday that the investigative reports and depositions that would surface in such a lawsuit&nbsp;<span>'</span>would interfere with Trooper Encinia&rsquo;s ability to receive a fair trial in the state criminal matter ... Given the media coverage of this case, public dissemination of reports could influence jurors.'</p>
<p>Bland's mother, Geneva Reed-Veal, filed a wrongful death lawsuit in August in U.S. district court. Reed-Veal is suing Encinia, the Department of Public Safety, Waller County and two jailers.</p>

<p>A Waller County grand jury in December chose not to indict anyone in Bland's death, but the panel later indicted the trooper for perjury based on conflicts between his written report and dashboard camera footage of the arrest. In the video, Encinia can be seen opening Bland's driver's side door and reaching in for her. She refuses to come out and the trooper threatens to use a Taser on her.</p>
<p>But in Encinia's report, he wrote: 'I had Bland exit the vehicle to further conduct a safe traffic investigation.' Special prosecutor Darrell Jordan said Wednesday that was the statement grand jurors keyed in on.</p>
<p><span style='line-height: 1.35;'>Cannon Lambert, the attorney for&nbsp;<span>Bland's family,&nbsp;</span>has been focused on obtaining the Texas Rangers' report on the arrest so he can depose witnesses and others involved in the investigation. The much sought-after report was under lock and key as the grand jury investigated the arrest and death of Bland.</span></p>
<p>With the panel's work done, Lambert says he wants the report now.</p>
<p>'Assuming that the court agrees with us that we should be provided the Ranger report, we would certainly oppose a stay' of the family's lawsuit, Lambert said. 'We wish to bring a fair and just resolution to this matter for the family. It is not fair or just that simply because Encinia was charged with a misdemeanor, Sandy's family should be put on the back burner.'</p>
<p>Hours after the Wednesday indictment, DPS said it would begin the process of firing Encinia. Encinia's attorney, Larkin Eakin Jr., said his client would appeal the move.</p>
<p>Encinia surrendered to the Texas Rangers on Thursday and was taken to the Waller County Jail, where he was released after posting bond.</p>
<p>If convicted of the misdemeanor perjury charge, Encinia could face up to a year in jail and a $4,000 fine.<span style='line-height: 1.35;'>&nbsp;Encinia plans to plead not guilty, Eakin said.</span></p>
<p>'They're going to have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that those words used were intended to deceive, and honestly, he does not feel, nor do I, that they are deceptive,' the attorney said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just because he didn't use the exact same words from his report does not mean the trooper perjured himself, Eakin said.</p>
<p>'They're going to have to show that he intended to commit perjury,' Eakin said, 'and I don't think they can do that with a fair jury.'</p>"
